LEP Boundaries - 2013
=====================

This git contains LEP Boundaries in various formats.

  - Wooster 2013 LEP (Shapefiles)
    A version created by Adrian Wooster, that all the other formats in the collection are based on. Read his blog post on the boundaries [here](http://wooster.org.uk/2013/10/local-enterprise-partnership-gis-files/). You can thank him / follow him [on twitter](https://twitter.com/awooster)

  - w84shp  (Shapefiles)
    An ogr2ogr conversion to shp to guarentee conformance with World Geodetic System 1984 format. The original might even be ws84, but I do it as a matter of course.

  - geoj (GeoJSON)
    An ogr2ogr conversion from ws84shp to geojson. Default settings.

  - topoj (TopoJSON)
    A topojso conversion from grojson to topojson. Default settings.
